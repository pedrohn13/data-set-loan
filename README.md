# Main Objective
The main objective is to practice knowledge of Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Statistics. For this, a Business Process Intelligence (BPI) data set was selected.

# About Dataset
The dataset was found on the website of the 13th International Business Process Intelligence Workshop 2017.

The logs refer to a loan application process of a Dutch financial institute. The data includes all the loan process logs including offers made by the company for accepted loan applications.

For more information about the data, you can consult the event page in the 'The Data' section or directly in the page of the dataset.

# Results
Some exploratory data analyzes were performed with graphical visualizations and construction of models to make some predictions, to answer the following questions:

1. In which month of the year did the most loan requests occur?
2. According to the purpose of the loan, which month had the most requests?
3. How many days does it take on average for an application that has been accepted to be finalized? 
4. Is it possible to predict how long an application will be completed?

The result was satisfactory for the main objective.
